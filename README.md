# Stats2
## What is it?
Stats2 takes list of requests from *RequestManager2* and stores smaller (not all attributes) copy of all requests. It also takes nuber of open/done events from *dbs* and collects history for each dataset in all requests.
Main improvement over old Stats is that Stats2 fetch only changes since last update. As a result, updates take no more than few seconds and can be performed as frequently as desired.
## No Javascript!
Stats2 has 0 javascript. However, it uses Jinja2 templates a lot.
## Console usage
Usually Stats2 should be viewed and controlled from web browser, but it  can be used as a python script as well:
Update all requests:
```
python3 stats_update.py --action update
```
Update one request (NAME is request name):
```
python3 stats_update.py --action update --name NAME
```
Preview one request (NAME is request name):
```
python3 stats_update.py --action see --name NAME
```
Drop all databases (I don't know why this function is still here):
```
python3 stats_update.py --action drop
```
Note that update actions require two environment variables: `USERKEY` and `USERCRT` which should point to user GRID certificate and key files.
